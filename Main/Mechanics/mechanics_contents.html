    <h1>What are mechanics?</h1>
    <div>The mechanics page features common prison mechanics used by the MPC. 
         There are two major classes of prison mechanics: defensive measures used by prison builders to keep 
         them secure, and escapists' strategies for breaking in or out of a prison.</div>
